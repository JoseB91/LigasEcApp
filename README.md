## Leagues Feature Specs

### Story: Customer requests to see Ecuadorian leagues

### Narrative

 Then the app should display hardcoded leagues
  And save those leagues to cache 
  And if saving fails, delete the cache
  
Given an online/offline customer
  And there's a cached version of the leagues
 When the customer requests to see the leagues
 Then the app should display hardcoded leagues
  And don't save those leagues to cache
